# **1. What is SAP MM (very short)**

**SAP MM = Materials Management**.
**It is the SAP module that manages all activities related to buying materials and managing inventory (stock).**
**MM helps companies make sure the right material is available at the right time, in the right quantity, and at the right cost.**

---

# **2. Main objects & documents you must remember**

**(these are the building blocks of Purchase & Inventory)**

- **Material Master** — **a record for each material** (name, unit, price, stock info).
- **Vendor Master** — **a record for each supplier** (name, address, payment terms).
- **Purchase Requisition (PR)** — **internal request** to buy or produce material.
- **Purchase Order (PO)** — **formal order sent to vendor**.
- **Goods Receipt (GR)** — **when material arrives and is posted into stock**.
- **Invoice Receipt (IR)** — **vendor invoice posted, matches PO & GR** (this makes payment possible).
- **Material Document** — **record created for every goods movement** (e.g., GR).
- **Accounting Document** — **financial posting created for GR/IR/PO-related transactions**.
- **Reservation** — **internal hold of stock for a purpose (e.g., production)**.
- **MRP (Material Requirement Planning)** — **planning tool that creates demands/PRs**.

**Bold summary:** **Material Master**, **Vendor Master**, **PR**, **PO**, **GR**, **IR**, **MRP**.

# **3. Key concepts (simple and important)**

- **Stock types:** **Unrestricted (usable)**, **Reserved** (for a purpose), **Blocked** (quality issue), **In quality inspection**.
- **Valuation:** Materials have **value (price)** — SAP keeps track so finance knows inventory value.
- **Movement Type:** Each goods movement has a **type code** (e.g., 101 = goods receipt against PO).
- **Procurement Types:** **External procurement** (buy from vendor) or **Internal procurement** (produce in-house).
- **Source Determination:** SAP can use **Info Record, Source List, or Quota Arrangement** to decide which vendor to use.
- **Approval workflows:** PR → approvals (if required) → PO. Many companies require manager approvals.

---

# **4. How the Purchase Department works (step-by-step, simple)**

**Overall short flow:**
**Need identified → Request (PR) → Purchase Dept creates/approves PO → Vendor supplies → Goods Receipt → Invoice → Payment.**

Detailed steps:

1. **Need identification**

   - A department (production, sales, stores) notices a need for material.
   - If stock is insufficient, a **requirement** is created. (This can be manual or by **MRP**.)

2. **Create Purchase Requisition (PR)**

   - **PR = internal request** to buy or produce a material (includes material, qty, delivery date).
   - PR can be **created manually** or **auto-generated by MRP**.

3. **Source determination & vendor selection**

   - Purchase team finds who can supply: check **Vendor Master**, **Info Record**, **Source List**.
   - They may **send RFQ** (Request for Quotation) or use existing vendor.

4. **Create Purchase Order (PO)**

   - **PO is the official order** sent to vendor (contains material, qty, price, delivery date).
   - PO number is created and usually sent to vendor by email or EDI.

5. **Goods Receipt (GR)**

   - When goods arrive, store/warehouse checks them.
   - **GR is posted in SAP**: stock increases, **Material Document** & **Accounting Document** are created.
   - If items are for production, stock might be **reserved** or **issued** to production.

6. **Invoice Receipt (IR) / Invoice Verification**

   - Vendor sends invoice. Purchase/finance matches **PO + GR + Invoice** (three-way match).
   - If OK, invoice is posted; this triggers an accounting posting and sets up payment to vendor.

7. **Payment**

   - Finance pays vendor as per payment terms after invoice posting.

**Bold paragraph:** **The purchase department organizes and controls these steps so the company gets correct material, at the right time and price.**

# **5. Manufacturing scenario — full end-to-end flow (detailed)**

**Context:** Company _makes_ material X and sells to customer. The customer makes an order first.

**Example facts:** Customer orders **100 units** of material **X**.

**Flow (step-by-step with SAP documents & actions):**

1. **Customer Purchase Order → Sales Order (SD module)**

   - Customer sends PO → Sales team creates **Sales Order** (in SD).
   - SAP checks availability (ATP) — if stock < required, production is needed.

2. **Check Stock in Warehouse**

   - **Stock for X = 0** (unrestricted). So no available stock.

3. **Create Production Requirement**

   - Sales order triggers **demand**.
   - **Production Planning (PP)** creates a **Production Order** or **Planned Order** to make 100 units.
   - Alternatively, **MRP** can run and create planned orders.

4. **Production requests raw materials → Purchase Dept if needed**

   - Production creates **reservation** or **material requirements** for raw materials.
   - If raw materials are missing, those create **Purchase Requisitions (PR)** for raw materials (e.g., steel, parts).

5. **Purchase Dept processes PR → creates PO to vendor**

   - Purchase team sources vendors and creates **PO** for raw materials (external suppliers).
   - If vendor delivers subcontracted parts, purchasing handles that too.

6. **Vendor delivers raw material → Goods Receipt (GR)**

   - Warehouse posts **GR** (movement type 101). Stock of raw material increases.

7. **Production consumes raw material → Goods Issue to Production**

   - When production uses raw materials, warehouse posts **Goods Issue** (movement type 261) to Production Order.
   - This reduces raw material stock and increases work-in-progress (WIP).

8. **Production completes finished goods → Goods Receipt into Finished Goods stock**

   - When production finishes, a **Goods Receipt** for Production Order posts finished goods into stock (often movement 101/other relevant).
   - Finished goods stock now has **100 units of X**.

9. **Delivery to Customer**

   - Sales creates **Delivery Document** and posts **Goods Issue** to customer (stock reduces).
   - Billing creates invoice to customer.

10. **Invoice verification for raw materials**

- Vendor invoices are verified and posted (IR), finance pays vendors.

**Key SAP documents to remember in manufacturing flow:** **Sales Order (SD)**, **Planned Order / Production Order (PP)**, **Purchase Requisition (PR)**, **Purchase Order (PO)**, **Goods Receipt (GR)**, **Goods Issue (GI)**, **Invoice Receipt (IR)**.

**Bold paragraph:** **Manufacturing flow is longer because there are extra steps: production planning, reservations, consumption of raw materials, and conversion into finished goods.**

---

# **6. Trading (distribution/retail) scenario — full flow (detailed)**

**Context:** Company does NOT manufacture. They **buy ready goods** and **sell them** (like a supermarket or distributor).

**Example facts:** Customer wants **100 units** of product **Y**. Company does not make Y; must buy from vendor.

**Flow (step-by-step with SAP documents & actions):**

1. **Sales Order from customer (SD)**

   - Customer sends PO → Sales team creates **Sales Order**.

2. **Check Stock**

   - SAP checks if **stock of Y** is available.
   - If stock >= 100 → allocate stock for the customer → pick-pack-ship.
   - If stock < 100 (or 0), purchase is needed immediately.

3. **Create Purchase Requisition (PR)**

   - Purchase Requisition is created for **100 units** of Y for sales order requirement (sometimes PR is created directly from Sales Order via special process or through MRP).

4. **Purchase Dept creates Purchase Order (PO) to vendor**

   - Select vendor, price, delivery date → create **PO** for 100 units.

5. **Vendor delivers goods → Goods Receipt (GR)**

   - Warehouse posts **GR**; stock increases.

6. **Immediate delivery to customer or allocate stock**

   - If timeline tight, goods may be received and immediately issued to the Sales Delivery (GI), or staged for picking.
   - **Goods Issue** against delivery reduces stock and completes shipping.

7. **Invoice & Payment**

   - Vendor invoice posted (IR) → vendor paid by finance.
   - Customer invoiced and company receives payment (SD/Finance).

**Bold paragraph:** **Trading flow is simpler: buy finished goods → receive them → sell them. Fewer internal steps than manufacturing.**

---

# **7. Differences between Manufacturing & Trading (quick summary)**

- **Manufacturing:**

  - **Creates finished goods** from raw materials.
  - **Key extra steps:** Production planning, production orders, consumption of raw materials, WIP.
  - **PRs often for raw materials** (not finished goods).

- **Trading (Retail/Distribution):**

  - **Buys finished goods** and sells them.
  - **Simpler flow:** PR → PO → GR → GI → Invoice.
  - **No production orders or BOMs.**

**Bold paragraph:** **Manufacturing = make + buy raw materials. Trading = buy finished goods and sell.**

---

# **8. Important SAP MM settings and master data that help these flows**

- **Material Master** — includes views for **Basic Data**, **Purchasing**, **Inventory**, **Accounting**.
- **Vendor Master** — vendor details, payment terms, purchasing organization data.
- **Purchasing Info Record** — stores vendor-specific price & delivery data for a material.
- **Source List** — approved vendor list for a material (helps auto-source).
- **Quota Arrangement** — split procurement among multiple vendors.
- **Release Strategy** — approval process for PR/PO (who must approve).
- **MRP Type & Reorder Point** — determines how PRs are created (e.g., automatic by MRP or manual reorder).

---

# **9. Common problems & checks (what Purchase Dept watches for)**

- **Stock check before buying** — avoid overstocking.
- **Three-way match fails** — PO / GR / Invoice mismatch needs resolution.
- **Delayed vendor delivery** — causes production delay or backorder.
- **Quality issues** — goods may be blocked until quality check.
- **Price differences** — Invoice price different from PO → needs approval.
- **Rescheduling or partial deliveries** — need schedule lines or multiple GRs.

**Bold paragraph:** **Purchase Dept must monitor stock, delivery dates, prices, and quality to keep operations smooth.**

---

# **10. Useful SAP transactions (names you’ll see in system)**

(Just names — you don’t need to memorize now, but good to know)

- **ME51N** — Create Purchase Requisition (PR).
- **ME21N** — Create Purchase Order (PO).
- **MIGO** — Goods Movement (GR, GI).
- **MIRO** — Invoice Receipt (post vendor invoice).
- **MM01 / MM02** — Create / Change Material Master.
- **XK01 / XK02** — Create / Change Vendor Master.
- **MD01 / MD02** — MRP run or single-item planning.
- **COOIS / CO01** — Production Order related (PP area).
- **VL01N / VL02N** — Delivery documents (SD).

**Bold paragraph:** **These are the transaction screens you’ll use frequently in SAP MM.**

---

# **11. A small example in 6 lines (to remember the core)**

**Manufacturing:** **Sales Order → Production Order → PR for raw materials → PO to vendor → GR of raw materials → Production → GR finished goods → Delivery to customer.**

**Trading:** **Sales Order → PR/PO for finished goods → PO to vendor → GR finished goods → Delivery to customer → Invoice.**

**Bold paragraph:** **That one-line flow helps you remember the big difference.**

---

# **12. Tips to learn & remember**

- **Memorize the documents order:** **PR → PO → GR → IR → Payment.**
- **Visualize the warehouse:** imagine stock shelves and the paper trail for every movement.
- **Practice transactions in SAP GUI** (or demo) — real practice cements memory.
- **Always link actions to a business reason** (why did we create PR? for production or for sales?).

---

If you want, next I can:

- **Show a simple diagram** (text art) of the flows,
- **Write step-by-step examples using exact fields** for PR and PO, or
- **Explain one of the transactions (ME51N, ME21N, MIGO, MIRO)** in detail so you can practice.

Which one would help you most next?
