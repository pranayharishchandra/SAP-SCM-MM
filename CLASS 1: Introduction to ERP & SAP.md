Okay! 😊 Let’s start from the **very beginning** so you can understand **SAP vs ERP** clearly and remember it for a long time.

**ERP** stands for **Enterprise Resource Planning**.

It is **a type of software system** used by companies to **manage all their business processes** in **one place**.

### 💡 Think of ERP like this:

A company has many departments:

- **Sales** → sells products
- **Purchase** → buys raw materials
- **Production** → makes products
- **Finance** → manages money
- **HR** → manages employees

👉 Normally, each department uses its **own software**, which causes **confusion** and **data duplication**.

👉 **ERP software** connects all these departments into **one single system**, so everyone sees the **same real-time data**.
